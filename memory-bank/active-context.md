# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Based on the Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator codebase, this document tracks the current development focus, recent changes, and upcoming priorities.

### Current Focus

The project appears to be in a mature state with a complete implementation of core functionality. Current focus areas appear to be:

1. **User Experience Refinement**: The web interface is well-developed with attention to progress tracking and data visualization.

2. **Data Standards Compliance**: Ensuring generated data meets military medical standards (FHIR, SNOMED CT, etc.).

3. **Output Security Options**: Implementation of compression and encryption for sensitive patient data.

4. **Realistic Patient Flow Simulation**: Modeling patient progression through medical facilities with statistically realistic outcomes.

### Recent Changes

Based on the codebase, recent development appears to have included:

1. **Web Interface Implementation**: A complete Bootstrap-based UI with job management and visualization features.

2. **Background Task Processing**: Implementation of asynchronous job handling for patient generation.

3. **Output Formatting Options**: Addition of multiple output formats with security options.

4. **FHIR Bundle Generation**: Implementation of HL7 FHIR R4 bundle creation.

5. **Testing Framework**: Development of unit tests for core components.

6. **Deployment Documentation**: Created Docker deployment guide (`DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md`).

7. **Docker Environment**: Fixed `Dockerfile` and successfully built and tested the development Docker environment (`docker-compose.dev.yml`).

### Next Steps

Likely upcoming development priorities include:

1. **Documentation Expansion**: 
   - Enhancing user guides and API documentation
   - Creating more examples for different use cases
   - Developing training materials for new users

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profiling and optimizing generation for large datasets
   - Implementing parallel processing options
   - Memory usage optimization

3. **Deployment Enhancements**:
   - Docker deployment guide created and development environment tested successfully.
   - Setting up CI/CD pipelines.
   - Further refinement and testing of production and other Docker deployment strategies.

4. **Feature Extensions**:
   - Supporting additional nationalities
   - Adding more detailed medical condition modeling
   - Implementing more complex patient flow scenarios
   - Creating connectors for specific military medical systems

5. **UI Improvements**:
   - Adding user authentication
   - Implementing saved configuration profiles
   - Developing enhanced visualization options
   - Creating a patient record viewer

### Active Decisions

Key architectural and implementation decisions that appear to be active include:

1. **Modular Generation Pipeline**: The generation process is broken into distinct modules (flow, demographics, medical, FHIR, formatting) allowing for independent development and testing.

2. **Standards-Based Approach**: The system prioritizes compliance with medical data standards to ensure interoperability.

3. **Web + CLI Interfaces**: Maintaining both interfaces to support different user needs and automation scenarios.

4. **In-Memory Processing**: Current implementation processes data in memory rather than using a database, which is suitable for the batch nature of the generation.

5. **Statistically-Driven Simulation**: Patient flow is modeled using statistical distributions rather than fixed pathways, creating more realistic variation.

### Current Challenges

Based on the codebase, these challenges are likely being addressed:

1. **Memory Management**: Generating large numbers of patients with comprehensive FHIR data could strain memory resources.

2. **Performance vs. Realism**: Balancing generation speed with the level of detail in patient simulations.

3. **Security Requirements**: Ensuring appropriate handling of synthetic but potentially sensitive medical data.

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the web interface works consistently across different browsers and devices.

5. **Configurability vs. Simplicity**: Providing enough customization options while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

### Working Environment

The project appears to be developed using:

1. **Python 3.8+**: Modern Python with type hints and object-oriented design.

2. **FastAPI**: Asynchronous web framework for the backend API.

3. **Bootstrap 5**: Frontend framework for responsive design.

4. **Standard Development Tools**: Virtual environments, package management via pip, unit testing.

### Collaboration Context

The project appears to be set up for collaboration with:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns allowing developers to work on different components.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: README, installation guides, and getting started documentation.

3. **Unit Testing**: Test coverage for core functionality to ensure collaborative changes don't break existing features.

4. **Standardized Interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between components to facilitate parallel development.
