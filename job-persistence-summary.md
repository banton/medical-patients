# Job Persistence Database Fix - Summary

## Issue Resolved
Jobs were only stored in memory (`InMemoryJobRepository`), causing them to be lost on app restart. This resulted in stuck jobs that couldn't be recovered and potential memory issues with large job counts.

## Solution Implemented
1. Created `DatabaseJobRepository` class that stores all jobs in PostgreSQL
2. Updated dependency injection to use database repository instead of in-memory
3. Fixed import errors to use correct class names from database pool

## Key Changes
- `src/infrastructure/database_job_repository.py` - New database repository implementation
- `src/api/v1/dependencies/services.py` - Updated to use database repository
- `src/domain/models/job.py` - Added auto-generation of job_id in __post_init__

## Verification Complete
✅ Jobs persist in PostgreSQL `jobs` table
✅ Jobs survive app restarts
✅ Large jobs (5000 patients) tracked properly
✅ Multiple concurrent jobs supported
✅ All job fields properly serialized/deserialized

## Database Table
Jobs are now stored with full details including:
- job_id, status, progress, timestamps
- config (JSONB), progress_details (JSONB)
- error messages, output files, summary

The system is now production-ready with proper job persistence.
