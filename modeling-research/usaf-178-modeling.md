ABSTRACT
Introduction:
Computer simulations are becoming increasingly important in addressing the inherent limitations of medical planning for
large-scale combat operations (LSCO). This technology offers a unique capability to model complex tactical scenarios
that have not been encountered in past operations. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of computer simulations
in enhancing military medical support for LSCO.

Methods:
We collected and analyzed data from the NATO Live Exercise (LIVEX) Vigorous Warrior/Clean Care (VW/CC’24),
incorporating both quantitative and qualitative observations from the point of injury to various levels of care, including
Role 1, Role 2, and Role 2E. Our assessment focused on triage, damage control resuscitation, damage control surgery,
and decontamination. The data was employed to recreate the scenario with a discrete-event computer simulator named
SIMEDIS. The simulation was developed based on hourly observations recorded by the research team. The placement
and capacities of Military Medical Treatment Facilities within the exercise were integrated into the model. Each simulated
casualty was assigned injuries and clinical progressions as defined in the LIVEX scenario. Laydown of Military Medical
Treatment Facilities within the exercise, along with their capacities, were incorporated.

Results:
Transport, triage, and treatment processes were simulated using procedural guidelines and time estimates derived from
observations made during VW/CC’24. The simulation of the LIVEX within SIMEDIS is presented, and the number of
ambulances is varied with a direct impact on mortality.

Discussion:
This report focuses on the similarities between the LIVEX and the computer simulation although also identifying gaps
relevant  to  LSCO  scenarios.  The  application  of  modeling  and  simulation  to  a  LIVEX  aims  to  establish  a  precedent
for  its  use  in  future  events  beyond  traditional  table-top  exercises,  offering  a  novel  methodology  based  on  real  field
measurements. The objective is to utilize computer simulations to estimate clinical timelines and create a test platform for
assessing and evaluating LSCO scenarios in a cost-effective way in a safe-to-fail environment. This approach enhances
LIVEX planning by enabling the simulation of large-scale casualty influxes and logistical challenges without the need
for extensive personnel mobilization.

Conclusion
: The integration of computer simulations with military exercises offers a powerful method for improving LIVEX prepa-
ration to meet training objectives and can also be tailored for medical planning in LSCO. By leveraging data-driven
modeling, military planners can better predict, assess, and optimize medical responses and courses of actions, ultimately
enhancing readiness for LSCO.

INTRODUCTION

Strategies to Improve Medical Readiness

A New Medical Support Paradigm

Over  the  past  two  decades,  NATO’s  medical  Concepts  of
Operations (CONOPS) have centered on counterinsurgency,
relying  on  air  superiority,  sufficient  medical  resources,  and
low casualty rates to ensure timely treatment of wounded per-
sonnel.  However,  Russia’s  hybrid  warfare  against  Ukraine
since  2014,  culminating  in  its  full-scale  invasion  in  2022,
has  heightened  geopolitical  tensions  and  poses  significant
challenges  to  NATO’s  defense  structures  and  allied  support
systems.  These  developments  underscore  the  need  to  adapt
NATO’s  strategic  concept.  1  Accordingly,  CONOPS  must
be  revised  based  on  evidence-driven  principles.  Anecdotal
reports from the Ukraine war indicate casualty numbers far
exceeding those in NATO’s Afghanistan operations, suggest-
ing  that  future  large-scale  conflicts  could  involve  a  sharp
rise  in  both  patient  volume  and  injury  severity.  2–4  Rapid
medical  treatment  remains  crucial  to  reduce  morbidity  and
mortality. Meanwhile, targeted attacks on healthcare facilities
have compelled Ukrainian leaders to develop alternative care
structures.4,5

Underground hospitals and mobile care units, coordinated
by  entities  such  as  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red
Cross, have sustained critical healthcare services in Ukraine.6
Collaborative efforts between the WHO, Médecins Sans Fron-
tières, and local healthcare providers have enabled the distri-
bution of medical supplies and training healthcare workers.7
Strengthening these partnerships not only ensures the imme-
diate continuation of care but also builds long-term capacity
and resilience in war-affected areas, enabling health systems
to  better  respond  to  the  challenges  posed  by  contemporary
warfare.

NATO  Standardization Agreement  2228,  outlined  in  the
Allied Joint Medical Support Doctrine (AJP-4.10),8 provides
the framework for joint medical support in NATO operations,
integrating civilian and military entities.  Medical Treatment
Facilities  (MTFs)  are  categorized  by  NATO  roles  (Role  1
(R1),  Role  2  Basic  (R2B),  Role  2  Forward  (R2F),  Role
2  Enhanced  (R2E),  Role  3  (R3),  and  Role  4  (R4)),  with
each role offering progressively advanced capabilities, posi-
tioned further from the front line. Although the conventional
approach follows this order,  tactical situations and resource
limitations  may  require  skipping  roles.  Additionally,  medi-
cal  personnel  fatigue  and  the  need  for  R1  or  R2  redeploy-
ment because of infrastructure damage must be considered in
large-scale combat operations (LSCO).

To support best practices in medical planning, new strategies
for evacuating patients in dynamic contexts require method-
ological approaches through “wargames” or “table-top exer-
cises” (TTXs), where participants role-play various scenarios
and  contingencies  in  a  controlled  environment.  A  higher-
fidelity and more practical approach involves Live Exercises
(LIVEXs), where events and casualties are re-enacted by role-
players. This method allows for the simulation of threats with
varying levels of authenticity, enabling responders to practice
elements  of  direct  patient  care,  transportation,  and  perform
medical procedures in a controlled yet dynamic environment
accounting for variables.

The Modeling and Simulation Approach

Modeling  and  Simulation  (M&S)  offers  an  alternative
approach,  running multiple statistically independent scenar-
ios without direct human intervention. Subject Matter Experts
(SMEs) or analysts define the parameters, enabling the eval-
uation  of  various  scenarios  and  statistical  analysis  of  key
impact factors. This method, known as Constructive Simula-
tion, differs from Live or Virtual simulations, which focus on
training rather than planning and decision-making.9 Despite
its potential, M&S has yet to be widely integrated into military
operations because of cultural barriers. We aim to demonstrate
its benefits for both LIVEX and operational planning.

Simulation models vary in granularity,  with higher detail
requiring  more  real-world  data.  However,  data  limitations
often  necessitate  assumptions  from  SMEs.  As  complexity
increases,  these  models  may  function  as  opaque  systems,
wherein  outcomes  arise  from  intricate  interactions  that  are
not  immediately  transparent.  Rigorous  validation  is  crucial
to establish trust and ensure acceptance. To enhance this, we
incorporate observations and firsthand data from the NATO
2024 Vigorous Warrior and Clean Care LIVEX (VW/CC’24)
experiment  described10  into  a  closed-loop  simulation  sys-
tem, improving validation and SME engagement. Organized
by  the  NATO  Centre  of  Excellence  for  Military  Medicine
(MILMEDCOE), VW/CC’24 is the Alliance’s largest military
medical interoperability exercise. The LIVEX is designed in
the  frame  of  a  NATO Article  5  collective  defense  against  a
near-peer adversary in training the Alliance to treat and care
for large casualty influx.

Another  advantage  of  leveraging  M&S  is  its  cost-
effectiveness  especially  when  working  at  scale.  Methods
of  Live  and Virtual  M&S  often  require  extensive  computer

resources to model large number of casualties in a realistic 3D
environment with little benefit for planning resource alloca-
tions. Training is to be seen as a separate objective and humans
must be solicited to “run” the simulations.

This research explores the benefits of integrating field mea-
surements and observations with scenario replay to validate
software  predictions  and  leverage  algorithms  for  alternative
outcomes. In LSCO, historical cases based on modern med-
ical support doctrine lack empirical support. To address this,
the VW/CC’24 exercise was recreated in the SIMEDIS (simu-
lation for the assessment and optimization of medical disaster
management) simulator, replicating real locations and patient
flow. Injuries and their progression were simulated, with time-
lines  derived  from  field  measurements  and  scripted  injects.
The following analysis compares the simulator’s predictions
with observed outcomes during the live exercise, reporting on
field data, the scenario, and a 1-day recreation of the LIVEX
using SIMEDIS.

METHODS
This  section  outlines  the  adaptation  of  the  SIMEDIS  simu-
lator model, and the scenario used in VW/CC’24. SIMEDIS
operates by simulating casualty streams over time through a
sequence of discrete events. Each event—such as the arrival
of a new casualty, a triage process, or a medical treatment—
alters  the  system’s  state.  The  actual  time  duration  of  these
events,  sampled  out  of  a  time  distribution,  serves  as  a  crit-
ical  input  parameter  for  the  simulations.  Unlike  continuous
simulation methods, this discrete-event approach enables the
efficient modeling of large systems and long-term scenarios
without compromising performance.

SIMEDIS Simulator

The  SIMEDIS  simulator  is  a  stochastic  discrete-event  sim-
ulator  that  recreates  the  prehospital  medical  response  in
the  aftermath  of  a  myriad  of  threats  ranging  from  con-
ventional  to  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  nuclear,
and explosive/environmental/endemic (CBRNE) weapon sys-
tems.  Originally  tailored  at  civilian  response,11–13  it  was
adapted  first  to  war-related  threats,14  and  includes  concepts
from NATO medical support doctrine.8 Each event, or threat,
generates casualties on the map. Every casualty’s location and
clinical status are saved to the output database,  and a medi-
cal response is simulated. The health state of each casualty is
modeled via a continuous mathematical model whose param-
eters depend on the casualty’s Injury Severity Score (ISS) or
Military Combat Injury  Score  (MCIS)15 and the age,  along
with intoxication levels for CBRNE. The setting of the ISS
or MCIS is based on military medical clinicians and planners
SMEs’ opinion and the description of the injuries in each stan-
dardized casualty card (or patient card). A link is established
between ISS/MCIS and the estimated time of death if no med-
ical  procedure  or  lifesaving  intervention  is  provided  to  the
casualty.10,16 To account for medical procedures’ effects on
casualty clinical status, a set of improvement equations is used

and parameterized by SMEs. For CBRNE-related injuries, we
use the injury profiles defined in the NATO Standards Related
Document  for  the  AMed-P7.5-1  for  Sarin  (GB)  as  further
researched by the authors for use in the simulator.17,18 Input
parameters include the number of ambulances, the number of
medical supplies,  and the capacity as well as capabilities of
each MTF. Medical procedures are also modeled,  including
triage and triage reassessment,  damage control resuscitation
(DCR) and damage control surgery (DCS), the application of
tourniquets (TQ), antidote application for nerve agents,  fol-
lowing established Clinical Practice Guidelines.19,20 Triage is
modeled upon first contact with a responder.  Depending on
whether  the  casualty  is  ambulatory  or  not,  he/she  is  loaded
on  an  available  litter  and  transported  towards  the  closest
established  Casualty  Collection  Point  (CCP).  In  NATO  ter-
minology and doctrine, triage categories are T1 (Immediate),
T2 (Urgent), T3 (Delayed/routine), and T4 (Expectant).

Simulated  Casualties  are  spawned  at  the  point  of
injury/point  of  exposure  (PoI/PoE)  and  are  transported  to  a
CCP. Once at the CCP, triage occurs and transport to a R1 is
simulated.  From  the  R1,  DCR  is  simulated  and  subsequent
transports to a R2 follows where triage occurs again before
DCS  ensues.  There  is  also  the  possibility  of  transporting  a
casualty straight from the CCP to a R2, or from a R2 to another
R2 to optimize medical resource utilization. In the simulator
output,  map  tiles  are  used  to  visualize  casualties,  respon-
ders,  and  MTF  laydown.  The  disaster  response  is  scripted
by a series of instructions and policies which vary between
simulation runs.

During  VW/CC’24,  the  location  of  all  casualties  was
known to the ambulance drivers via the presence of a NATO
Patient Evacuation Coordination Cell (PECC). The MTF lay-
down and CCP locations, known from the LIVEX plan, were
also recreated in the simulation. This information facilitated
the recreation of the LIVEX scenario within SIMEDIS. Once
the  casualty  was  created  in  the  simulation  and  geolocated
with  a  set  of  injuries  and  health  state  value,  an  algorithm
determined  the  first  life-saving  interventions  that  the  casu-
alty  needed  based  on  available  supplies  from  the  soldier’s
kit;  a  “combopen”  constituted  of  atropine  and  pralidoxime
if  the  casualty  was  exposed  to  a  chemical  agent,  and/or  a
TQ if the casualty had peripheral hemorrhage. The casualty
applied  these  specific  lifesaving  interventions  if  able  in  the
form of “self-aid,” or a nearby combatant/rescuer performed
the interventions as “buddy aid.” The locations of CCPs were
prescribed  and  defined  at VW/CC’24.  Therefore,  there  was
no modeling to account for finding a safe location to trans-
port casualties to as a CCP or stabilization point.  Transport
priority was based on triage and personnel availability. In the
case of a mass casualty incident (“MASCAL”),  T1 patients
were given priority followed by T2 for medical evacuations
(MEDEVAC). The simulator accounted for travel and trans-
port times (which include loading and/or unloading a patient
to the ambulance or vehicle of opportunity).  Transport des-
tination was determined  by  an  algorithm which establishes,

from  the  known  MTF  network,  the  closest  hospital  to  the
CCP which can admit the patient and has capacity. By design,
the closest MTF to a CCP were R1 MTFs, but some patients
were  scripted  in  the  scenario  to  walk  in  at  a  R2  facility.  In
this case, the casualty went to triage, stabilization with DCR,
and DCS when clinically indicated,  or transport to a higher
echelon of care. For R1 and R2, the holding time of casual-
ties were limited especially in MASCAL situations, especially
for  those  patients  post  DCR/DCS  requiring  Intensive  Care
Unit (ICU) support. We ensured that these times aligned with
observations in the field.

VW/CC’24 Scenario and Input MTF Laydown

The simulated crisis scenario was based on NATO’s OCCA-
SUS Exercise model within a fictional environment.  Prede-
fined operational phases justified the influx of casualties. Day
1 (D1) represented a 7-day Delay Operation aimed at hinder-
ing enemy advancement.  Days 2 and 3 (D2–D3),  simulated
to occur 7 days after D1, corresponded to Defensive Opera-
tions designed to establish conditions for (counter-)offensive
actions.  Day 4 (D4),  occurring 14 simulated days after D3,
represented a counter-offensive operation to secure the bor-
der.  Finally,  Day  5  (D5),  simulated  6  days  after  D4,  rep-
resented  a  Stabilization  Operation.  The  input  database  was
composed of the complete list of MTFs at VW/CC’24.  The
database specified the role of each MTF and whether it was
equipped to provide DCR, DCS, and/or able to perform casu-
alty decontamination. Additionally, the database included the
geographical coordinates and hourly capacity of each facility.
Furthermore,  information on all ambulances and evacuation
vehicles, including their initial coordinates, was incorporated
into the dataset.

VW/CC’24 Casualty Injects

Each day, an average number of 275 casualties were simulated
by  role-players  in  the  following  average  triage  repartitions
per day: 35.96% T1, 29.43% T2, 30.82% T3, and 3.79% T4
casualties per day.

Casualties presented a mix of trauma, burns, CBRNE, and
CBRNE  with  traumatic  injuries  resulting  from  an  array  of
events  including  conventional  and  chemical  artillery  explo-
sions,  Troops  in  Contact,  Improvised  Explosive  Devices,
Radiological  Dispersal  Devices,  building  fires,  and  an
unknown disease. The initial location of casualties was depen-
dent on each inject, some of them appearing at a designated
CCP or directly at a R1 or R2, in which case we defined the
start location of a patient at the R2 coordinates. Each T1 role-
player was assigned a case manager managing the patient’s
evolution. Each day, the total planned casualties were sched-
uled in the 0800 to 1600 timeframe by 30-minute intervals.
Most  of  the  time,  events  were  scripted  to  generate  multi-
ple  casualties  simultaneously,  simulating  MASCALs.  The
total number of patients was distributed across two brigades
(Brigade 1 (BDE 1) and Brigade 2 (BDE 2)). Figure 1 presents
the  schedule  along  with  triage  breakups  for  Day  1  of  the
LIVEX for BDE 1.

For simplicity and to compare with observations during the
LIVEX, we recreated the same injects, totaling 167 victims.
The  possibility  of  recreating  the  schedule  of  patients  in  the
simulator presents advantages. First, variations in the sched-
ule allow to experiment more MASCALs throughout the day
at  no  cost,  and  artificially  stress-test  the  MTFs.  The  triage
mix and injuries can be modified at will,  by insisting more
on CBRNE or trauma victims, highlighting key differences in
requirements both in terms of MTF type and medical coun-

and showcasing the possibilities of employing M&S, but addi-
tional quantitative analysis and experimentation is possible.

Measured in the Experiments) are Reported in Table 2 for Collected
Field Data With Selected T1 CBRN and Trauma Victims Versus

RESULTS
The schedule of planned casualties for Day 1 of the LIVEX
for BDE 1 was scripted, comprising three Battalions (Bn). We
located each casualty using latitude and longitude coordinates
and time throughout the simulation. A visual representation
of  the  BDE  1  MTF  laydown  as  well  as  limits  for  areas  of
responsibility are depicted in Figure 2.

Building  on  the  inject  definition,  health  state  evolution
parameters were determined using the estimated MCIS score
and known injury types, including trauma (amputations, pen-
etrating injuries),  blast and fragmentation injuries, chemical
injuries, and radiological injuries.

Collected Casualty Clinical Timelines Data from the
Field
As  described  in  our  precedent  article,10  we  conducted  an
experiment  during  the  LIVEX,  focused  at  collecting  time-
line for selected patients, to obtain baseline values for triage,
DCR, DCS, and decontamination times. We focused the col-
lection of patient clinical timelines on selected MTFs, because
of  the  limited  number  of  experimenters  and  the  number  of
simultaneous casualties to track. The collected field data are
displayed in Table 1.

• The  patient  distribution  policy,  as  transport  destinations
were  not  unique,  i.e.,  different  MTFs  could  receive  a

scenarios,  of  either  transporting  the  patient  to  the  Clos-
est MTF available (with a parameter named “CloseFirst”)
versus a random distribution amongst the available MTFs
(with a parameter named “SpreadOut”).

Figure 2, the base allocation for civilian ambulances in BDE
1 consisted of nine ambulances, supplemented by some of the
sixteen  reserve  ambulances,  which  were  dispatched  via  the
PECC and available to both brigades. In the VW/CC’24 sce-
nario, this number was deemed sufficient to handle the daily
injects, ensuring that all casualties survived unless specifically
scripted to die within the scenario.  Figure 3 shows the vari-
ation  in  mortality  outcomes  versus  the  number  of  available
ambulances  to  transport  all  victims  for  BDE  1.  The  differ-
ence  between  the  two  plots  is  the  MTF  distribution  policy
for patients. The simulator indicates that lower mortality out-
comes result from transporting patients to the closest available
MTF (“CloseFirst” parameter) rather than dispersing them to
minimize MTF saturation (with the “SpreadOut” parameter).
In  both  cases,  nine  ambulances  were  a  threshold  in  this
scenario above which mortality outcomes did not vary much
and were close to what was available during the LIVEX. But
as  the  simulation  results  indicate,  reducing  the  number  of
ambulances  further  results  in  an  increase  in  mortality  out-
comes (up to a 4-fold increase). During the LIVEX execution,
we observed issues with ambulances not arriving at the right
destination and drivers getting lost. We believe that a simu-
lation model as we have built could help in rehearsing ideal
cases  before  execution  to  mitigate  some  of  these  planning
issues. Another notion of ambulances being part of a pool of
transports rather than belonging to a specific MTF or Nation
simplified  the  outcomes  but  affected  the  LIVEX  which  we
define in this article as “communication issues.”

DISCUSSION
Employment  of  M&S  for  the  purpose  of  creating  a  replay
of  the  VW/CC’24  exercise  addresses  gaps  and  provides  a
novel  methodology.  The  transformative  potential  of  M&S
in  advancing  medical  planning  and  response  capabilities  in

LSCO  for  NATO  and  NATO  partners  are  described.  Inte-
grating  the  SIMEDIS  simulator  with  insights  gained  from
VW/CC’24  offers  a  novel  approach  to  addressing  the  com-
plexities  of  modern  battlefield  medicine.  The  comparative
analysis  of  M&S  and  LIVEX  reveals  both  their  unique
strengths  and  limitations,  providing  a  roadmap  for  enhanc-
ing  preparedness  in  future  conflict  scenarios.  M&S  stands
out for their ability to evaluate a wide array of scenarios and
contingencies  rapidly  and  cost-effectively.  Unlike  LIVEX,
where  constraints  such  as  time,  resources,  and  participant
fatigue restrict the scope and repeatability of scenarios, sim-
ulations  enable  sensitivity  analyses  that  reveal  critical  bot-
tlenecks  in  medical  response  systems;  and  can  be  applied
in  several  iterations  with  minimal  risk.  For  instance,  this
study demonstrated how ambulance/vehicle availability sig-
nificantly impacts mortality rates, insights that would be chal-
lenging  to  derive  from  a  single  iteration  of  a  live  exercise.
Additionally,  simulations  allow  for  controlled  experimenta-
tion  with  input  parameters,  offering  a  statistically  rigorous
evaluation of various operational strategies.

LIVEX  incorporates  human  factors—such  as  decision-
making  under  stress,  moral  dilemmas,  and  operational
friction—that  add  a  level  of  realism  often  absent  in  M&S.
Especially  when  different  nations  train  and  fight  together,
interoperability  and  language  barriers  significantly  impact
effectiveness.  For  example,  VW/CC’24  revealed  critical
aspects  of  interoperability  between  civilian  and  military
actors, emphasizing the need for seamless coordination across
sectors in complex disaster or combat scenarios.

This  experimental  study  underscores  the  value  of  lever-
aging  both  approaches  in  tandem.  Modeling  and  simula-
tion can complement TTX and LIVEX by providing a scal-
able  and  iterative  platform  for  testing  strategic  and  tactical
decisions.  Table-top  exercise  refines  high-level  strategies,
although LIVEX offers the realism of operational conditions,

including the unpredictability of human responses. Together,
these methods create a comprehensive framework for military
medical training and doctrine development; most notably for
NATO in the presence and preparation of LSCO. Despite these
advancements, the study identifies key areas for improvement.
Applications of this simulation model include modifications
in the MTF laydown and capacities,  studying the impact of
shortage  of  supplies  on  mortality  outcomes,  changing  the
number  or  schedule  of  victims  navigating  through  separate
phases  of  operations,  and  the  impact  of  R2F  relocation  in
the  simulation  scenario,  if  the  tactical  situation  requires  it.
AI can be leveraged to generate victims based on historical
patient data from trauma registries with treatment outcomes
determined from clinical data. Another improvement consists
in  introducing  persistent  threats  and  denial  in  the  evacua-
tions in the form of drone agents in the simulation.  Current
simulations lack dynamic battlefield conditions, such as tar-
geted  attacks  on  medical  personnel,  personnel  fatigue  and
stress, and facilities or equipment failures, which are critical
in real-world LSCO.

We believe that using a hybrid approach where visualiza-
tion  has  an  important  aspect,  rendering  part  of  the  analysis
more accessible to an array of experts who are not necessarily
used to interpreting data-driven analysis, is a key enabler for
acceptation of M&S in real-world settings, including military
operations, where quick decisions must be made in the field.
M&S, thanks to its safe-to-fail environment can test alterna-
tive Courses Of Actions (COAs) at no materiel and personnel
cost,  in  order  to  save  lives  before  engaging  in  dangerous
situations.

Limitations

The  reliance  on  assumptions  and  predefined  parameters
within  simulations  introduces  limitations.  Although  SMEs
play a crucial role in shaping these inputs, the outcomes may
lack validity in highly dynamic and unpredictable LSCO envi-
ronments.  This  study  has  several  limitations  that  should  be
addressed in future research. In the presented simulations, we
did  not  consider  that  the  personnel  in  charge  of  the  rescue
were  targeted,  and  we  also  did  not  consider  failing  equip-
ment, and damages to MTFs but these remain crucial events
to  consider  in  future  models.  The  simulations  relied  heav-
ily on assumptions and predefined parameters set by SMEs,
which may not fully capture the dynamic and unpredictable
nature  of  LSCO. Additionally,  critical  real-world  variables,
such as targeted attacks on medical personnel, equipment fail-
ures, access to adequate blood supplies and adversarial tactics,
were excluded from the simulations.

CONCLUSIONS
The evolving nature of modern warfare necessitates a change
in thinking in NATO’s medical support strategies. The lessons
learned  from  Ukraine  conflict  highlight  the  need  for  adapt-
able  and  resilient  medical  logistics,  emphasizing  real-time
casualty management, alternative care structures, and robust

collaboration  between  military  and  civilian  healthcare  enti-
ties.  The  use  of  simulation-based  planning  tools,  such  as
SIMEDIS, provides critical insights into casualty flow dynam-
ics,  resource  allocation,  and  the  impact  of  logistical  con-
straints on patient outcomes. Our analysis of the VW/CC’24
exercise  demonstrates  the  value  of  modeling  and  simula-
tion in refining casualty evacuation protocols and optimizing
resource  distribution.  The  findings  indicate  that  ambulance
availability, transport prioritization, and MTF selection signif-
icantly influence survival rates, reinforcing the need for data-
driven decision-making. Furthermore, integrating field obser-
vations into simulation models enhances validation, improv-
ing operational preparedness for large-scale combat scenarios.
Moving forward, NATO must prioritize the incorporation of
evidence-based casualty estimation models,  real-time simu-
lation exercises, and improved interoperability among allied
medical  units.  By  leveraging  these  approaches,  NATO  can
enhance  its  medical  readiness  and  ensure  a  more  effective
response to the complex challenges of contemporary warfare.
