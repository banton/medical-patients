# Version 1.1 Consolidation Plan

## Objective
Merge all 4 completed EPICs into a single v1.1 feature branch and resolve any integration issues.

## Branch Strategy

```
main
 └── develop
      └── feature/v1.1-consolidated
           ├── EPIC-001: Cross-platform dev environment
           ├── EPIC-002: API key management 
           ├── EPIC-003: Production scalability
           └── EPIC-006: Memory management

```

## Step-by-Step Consolidation Process

### Phase 1: Create v1.1 Branch

```bash
# 1. Ensure develop is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout develop || git checkout -b develop
git merge main

# 2. Create v1.1 feature branch
git checkout -b feature/v1.1-consolidated

# 3. Merge EPICs in order (handle conflicts as they arise)
git merge origin/epic/cross-platform-dev-env --no-ff -m "feat(v1.1): merge EPIC-001 cross-platform dev environment"
git merge origin/epic/api-key-management --no-ff -m "feat(v1.1): merge EPIC-002 API key management"
git merge origin/epic/production-scalability --no-ff -m "feat(v1.1): merge EPIC-003 production scalability"
git merge origin/epic/memory-management --no-ff -m "feat(v1.1): merge EPIC-006 memory management"
```

### Phase 2: Expected Merge Conflicts

Based on the EPICs, likely conflict areas:

1. **requirements.txt** - All EPICs likely added dependencies
2. **config.py** - Multiple configuration additions
3. **src/main.py** - API endpoint additions
4. **.github/workflows/ci.yml** - CI pipeline modifications
5. **docker-compose files** - Service additions
6. **Makefile** - New commands from different EPICs

### Phase 3: Integration Fixes

After merging, expected work items:

#### 1. Database Migrations
```bash
# Check migration order
alembic history

# May need to create a merge migration
alembic merge -m "Merge v1.1 migrations"

# Test full migration chain
alembic downgrade base
alembic upgrade head
```

#### 2. Configuration Consolidation
```python
# config.py - Unified configuration
class Config:
    # EPIC-001: Cross-platform
    PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_SETTINGS = {...}
    
    # EPIC-002: API Keys
    API_KEY_ENABLED = True
    API_KEY_HEADER = "X-API-Key"
    
    # EPIC-003: Scalability
    DATABASE_POOL_SIZE = 20
    WORKER_POOL_SIZE = 4
    ENABLE_METRICS = True
    
    # Combined settings
    REDIS_URL = os.getenv("REDIS_URL", "redis://localhost:6379")
```

#### 3. Dependency Resolution
```bash
# Resolve any version conflicts
pip-compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip check
```

#### 4. Test Suite Integration
```bash
# Run all tests to identify failures
pytest -v

# Fix test isolation issues
# Update fixtures for connection pooling
# Ensure API key tests work with async
```

### Phase 4: Fix & Build Approach

#### Week 1: Merge and Stabilize
- Day 1-2: Perform merges, resolve conflicts
- Day 3-4: Fix test failures
- Day 5: Integration testing

#### Week 2: Polish and Optimize
- Day 1-2: Performance testing
- Day 3-4: Documentation updates
- Day 5: Final testing

### Phase 5: Testing Strategy

```python
# tests/integration/test_v1_1_features.py
import pytest

@pytest.mark.integration
class TestV11Integration:
    """Test all v1.1 features working together"""
    
    async def test_full_stack_workflow(self):
        """Complete workflow using all EPICs"""
        # 1. Create API key (EPIC-002)
        # 2. Generate patients with pooled connections (EPIC-003)
        # 3. Monitor metrics (EPIC-003)
        # 4. Verify cross-platform (EPIC-001)
        
    async def test_performance_baseline(self):
        """Ensure v1.1 meets performance targets"""
        # Concurrent generation
        # Memory usage tracking
        # Response time verification
```

## Version 1.1 Feature Summary

Once consolidated, v1.1 will include:

1. **Complete API Key Management**
   - CLI tool for key lifecycle
   - Rate limiting
   - Usage tracking

2. **Production-Ready Scalability**
   - Connection pooling
   - Worker pools
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Streaming responses

3. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Windows, Linux, macOS
   - Docker support
   - Standardized tooling

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Intelligent memory management
   - Improved CLI tools
   - Better documentation

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All tests passing (>85% coverage)
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] Clean migration path from v1.0
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline green

## Rollback Plan

If integration becomes too complex:
```bash
# Create checkpoint
git tag v1.1-checkpoint-1

# If needed, reset to checkpoint
git reset --hard v1.1-checkpoint-1
```

## Timeline Estimate

- **Optimistic**: 1 week (if minimal conflicts)
- **Realistic**: 2 weeks (with integration fixes)
- **Pessimistic**: 3 weeks (if major refactoring needed)

## Next Steps

1. Create the v1.1 branch
2. Start merging EPICs
3. Document conflicts as they arise
4. Fix and test incrementally
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with v1.1 features
