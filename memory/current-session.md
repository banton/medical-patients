```

## 🎯 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Evacuation Timing System:
- **Facility hierarchy**: POI → Role1 → Role2 → Role3 → Role4
- **Triage categories**: T1 (urgent), T2 (delayed), T3 (minimal)  
- **Realistic timing ranges**: Based on military medical evacuation protocols
- **Rate modifiers**: T1 = 1.5x KIA risk, 0.8x RTD; T3 = 0.5x KIA risk, 1.2x RTD

### Timeline Tracking Implementation:
- **Event types**: arrival, evacuation_start, transit_start, kia, rtd, remains_role4
- **Temporal tracking**: Hours-since-injury calculated from injury timestamp
- **JSON serialization**: Proper datetime to ISO string conversion for export
- **Database storage**: Optional PatientDBModel with JSONB fields for complex data

### API Integration:
- **Authentication**: X-API-Key header with proper 401/403 status handling
- **Response format**: Standardized v1 API responses with comprehensive timeline data
- **Error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI schema updated with timeline endpoint specifications

## 🔧 **Critical Fix: Datetime JSON Serialization**

### Problem Identified:
- Patient generation jobs were failing with `TypeError: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable`
- Enhanced timeline tracking introduced datetime objects that couldn't be exported to JSON files

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Enhanced Patient class** with proper serialization methods:
   - `to_dict()` - Converts datetime objects to ISO strings
   - `to_json()` - Full JSON string export
   - `from_dict()` / `from_json()` - Proper deserialization with datetime parsing
2. **Updated patient generation service** to use `patient.to_dict()` instead of `patient.__dict__`
3. **Comprehensive round-trip testing** to ensure data integrity

### Result:
- ✅ All smoke tests now passing
- ✅ Patient generation jobs complete successfully with timeline data
- ✅ JSON export files contain properly serialized timeline information
