# Progress

## Current Status

The Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator appears to be a well-structured and developed project with comprehensive functionality. Based on the codebase, here's an assessment of its current status.

### What Works

1. **Core Patient Generation**:
   - Patient flow simulation through medical facilities (POI, R1-R4)
   - Realistic demographics generation based on nationality
   - Medical condition generation using SNOMED CT codes
   - HL7 FHIR R4 bundle creation

2. **Web Interface**:
   - Configuration form for generation parameters (`static/index.html`).
   - Job management system (`static/index.html`).
   - Progress tracking (`static/index.html`).
   - Data visualization of generation results (basic visualizations in `static/index.html`).
   - **Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (`static/visualizations.html`)**:
     - Successfully loads and displays advanced visualizations using React, Recharts, and Lucide-React.
     - Fetches data from backend API endpoints (`/api/visualizations/job-list`, `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data`).
     - The TSX component (`enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx`) is compiled using `esbuild` into `static/dist/bundle.js`.
   - File download functionality.

3. **Output Options**:
   - JSON and XML formatting
   - Compression with gzip
   - Encryption with AES-256-GCM
   - NDEF formatting for NFC tags

4. **Command Line Support**:
   - Demo script for direct usage
   - Configuration via JSON

5. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for core components.
   - Test fixtures for different scenarios.
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the `patient_generator.visualization_data.transform_job_data_for_visualization` function, covering various data scenarios (empty lists, different patient flows, distributions).
   - As part of this testing, a bug was identified and fixed in `transform_job_data_for_visualization` where default Sankey diagram nodes were not correctly initialized when no patient data was present. All Python unit tests are currently passing.
   - **Frontend Testing (Enhanced Visualization Dashboard)**:
     - Jest and React Testing Library configured for `enhanced-visualization-dashboard.test.tsx`.
     - All frontend tests are passing, including those for data loading, tab navigation, and filtering.
     - Initial `act()` warnings during test runs have been resolved.

6. **Docker Development Environment**:
   - `Dockerfile` fixed and `docker-compose.dev.yml` successfully builds and runs.
   - Web interface and API docs accessible in the dev container.

### What's Left to Build/Improve

1.  **Documentation**:
    *   API documentation for visualization endpoints could be expanded.
    *   User guides for the new enhanced visualization dashboard.
    *   Documentation for the frontend build/test process.
2.  **Deployment**:
    *   Further refinement and testing of production and other Docker configurations, considering the new frontend build step.
    *   Load balancing for high-volume usage.
3.  **Extended Features (General)**:
    *   Additional nationalities and languages.
    *   More detailed medical conditions and treatments.
    *   Integration with other medical systems.
4.  **UI Enhancements (Beyond current dashboard)**:
    *   Patient record viewer (detailed drill-down).
    *   Advanced filtering and search capabilities within the dashboard.
    *   User authentication and saved configuration profiles.
5.  **Performance Optimization**:
    *   **Frontend**: Optimize `static/dist/bundle.js` size (e.g., externalize large libraries).
    *   **Backend**: Profiling and optimizing generation for large datasets (ongoing).
    *   Memory optimization for very large datasets (ongoing).

### Overall Status

The project is in a strong functional state with robust core patient generation capabilities and significantly improved data visualization through the new React-based enhanced dashboard. Both web interfaces (main generator and advanced visualizations) and command-line support are operational. The introduction of frontend testing and a build process marks a significant step in modernizing the frontend architecture. The codebase remains well-structured.

The application is near production-ready, with comprehensive features and a solid testing foundation for both backend and key frontend components.

### Known Issues

**Resolved Recently:**
-   Initial loading errors for the Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (related to Babel, Recharts, and TSX compilation) have been fixed.
-   404 errors for visualization API endpoints (e.g., `/api/visualizations/job-list`) have been resolved (primarily by ensuring backend server runs latest code).
-   500 Internal Server Error for `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data` (caused by `TypeError` in data transformation) has been fixed.
-   React Testing Library `act()` warnings in frontend tests have been resolved.

**Current Considerations:**
1.  **Frontend Bundle Size**: `static/dist/bundle.js` is ~2.1MB, which could be optimized.
2.  **Recharts Console Warning**: A minor console warning from `recharts` about chart dimensions (width/height 0) appears during Jest tests in JSDOM. This does not affect test success or application functionality.
3.  **Memory Usage (Ongoing)**: Generating large numbers of patients could still require significant memory.
4.  **Security Considerations (Ongoing)**: Key management for encryption in production.
5.  **Scalability (Ongoing)**: Backend patient generation is sequential within `run_generator_job` after initial parallel patient creation.
6.  **Internationalization**: UI is English only.

### Next Steps

Suggested priorities for continued development:

1.  **Enhanced Visualization Dashboard**:
    *   Further develop and refine visualizations.
    *   Consider addressing the minor `recharts` console warning in tests if deemed necessary.
2.  **Performance Optimization**:
    *   Optimize frontend bundle size for `static/dist/bundle.js`.
    *   Continue backend performance profiling for large data generation.
3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Expand user guides for the new dashboard and document frontend build/test commands.
    *   Update `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` to include notes on frontend asset building if applicable to Docker workflows.
4.  **Deployment Enhancements**:
    *   Continue refining Docker deployment strategies.
    *   Consider CI/CD pipeline setup.
5.  **Extended Testing**: Add more comprehensive integration and potentially end-to-end testing for the full application flow, including the new dashboard.
6.  **User Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback on the new visualization dashboard.
