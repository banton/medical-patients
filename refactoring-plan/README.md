# Medical Patients Generator - Performance Refactoring Plan

This folder contains a comprehensive plan for refactoring the Medical Patients Generator application to improve performance and scalability.

## Contents

1. **REFACTORING_PROMPT.md** - Main refactoring document with:
   - Detailed implementation steps for each task
   - Test cases and verification procedures
   - Success metrics and rollback plans

2. **code_examples.py** - Concrete code examples showing:
   - Before/after code changes
   - New implementations
   - Usage patterns

3. **test_utilities.py** - Testing helpers including:
   - Database connection monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Cache performance measurement
   - Load testing scripts

4. **implementation_checklist.md** - Step-by-step checklist to track progress

## Overview

The refactoring focuses on three main areas:

### 1. Database Connection Management
- **Goal**: Eliminate connection pool exhaustion
- **Approach**: Remove legacy database class, use enhanced connection pooling everywhere
- **Expected Impact**: 70% reduction in database connections

### 2. Patient Generation Pipeline
- **Goal**: Handle 100K+ patients without memory issues
- **Approach**: True streaming generation, in-memory temporal configs
- **Expected Impact**: 50% faster generation, flat memory usage

### 3. Smart Caching Strategy
- **Goal**: Reduce database queries and improve response times
- **Approach**: Startup cache warming, computation caching, smart invalidation
- **Expected Impact**: 90%+ cache hit rate, <50ms API responses

## Getting Started

1. Review REFACTORING_PROMPT.md for the complete plan
2. Use implementation_checklist.md to track progress
3. Reference code_examples.py for specific implementations
4. Use test_utilities.py for testing each phase

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- Database connections (target: <20 concurrent)
- Memory usage during generation (target: <500MB)
- Generation time for 50K patients (target: <2 minutes)
- Cache hit rate (target: >90%)
- API response time (target: <50ms)

## Implementation Timeline

- **Task 1**: 1-2 days (Database consolidation)
- **Task 2**: 2-3 days (Generation pipeline)
- **Task 3**: 1-2 days (Smart caching)
- **Integration Testing**: 1 day
- **Total**: ~1 week

## Important Notes

- Each task can be implemented independently
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Extensive testing at each phase ensures safety
- Rollback procedures are documented for each change

For questions or clarifications, refer to the main documentation or create an issue in the project repository.
