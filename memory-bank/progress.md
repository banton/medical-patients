# Progress

## Current Status

The Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator is embarking on a major architectural overhaul to introduce comprehensive configurability, support for all NATO nations, a new API layer, and migration to a PostgreSQL database.

The project is currently at the **beginning of Phase 0: Foundation & Setup** of this new initiative. This phase focuses on establishing the necessary groundwork, including setting up the Git branching model, configuring PostgreSQL, integrating Alembic for database migrations, and refactoring the database interaction layer.

### What Works (Prior to New Initiative)

(This section describes the state of the application *before* the new architectural changes. It will be updated as new capabilities from the phased plan are completed.)

1.  **Core Patient Generation**:
    *   Patient flow simulation through medical facilities (POI, R1-R4) - *to be refactored for configurability*.
    *   Realistic demographics generation based on nationality - *to be expanded for all NATO nations and made configurable*.
    *   Medical condition generation using SNOMED CT codes, with support for multiple primary conditions.
    *   HL7 FHIR R4 bundle creation.

2.  **Web Interface**:
    *   Configuration form for generation parameters (`static/index.html`) - *to be supplemented/replaced by new advanced configuration UI*.
    *   Job management system (`static/index.html`).
    *   Progress tracking (`static/index.html`).
    *   Data visualization of generation results (basic visualizations in `static/index.html`).
    *   **Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (`static/visualizations.html`)**:
        *   Successfully loads and displays advanced visualizations using React, Recharts, and Lucide-React.
        *   Fetches data from backend API endpoints (`/api/visualizations/job-list`, `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data`).
        *   The TSX component (`enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx`) is compiled using `esbuild` into `static/dist/bundle.js`.
    *   File download functionality.

3.  **Output Options**:
    *   JSON and XML formatting
    *   Compression with gzip
    *   Encryption with AES-256-GCM
    *   NDEF formatting for NFC tags

4.  **Command Line Support**:
    *   Demo script for direct usage
    *   Configuration via JSON - *to be updated for new configuration structure*.

5.  **Testing**:
    *   Unit tests for core Python components.
    *   Frontend tests for `enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx` using Jest and React Testing Library.
    *   All existing unit tests (Python and frontend) were passing prior to this new initiative.

6.  **Docker Development Environment**:
    *   `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` were functional for the previous SQLite-based setup. *Will be updated for PostgreSQL.*

### What's Left to Build/Improve (Focus of the New Initiative)

The primary focus is the implementation of the new configurability architecture, broken down into phases:

1.  **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Current)**
    *   Git branching model.
    *   PostgreSQL setup (clean install, replacing SQLite).
    *   Alembic integration for schema migrations.
    *   Refactor `database.py` for PostgreSQL and connection pooling.
2.  **Phase 1: Backend Configuration Abstraction & Core Logic**
    *   Database models and schema for configurations (fronts, nationalities, facilities).
    *   `ConfigurationRepository` for DB interaction.
    *   NATO nations data repository and integration.
    *   Refactor `PatientFlowSimulator`, `DemographicsGenerator`, `PatientGeneratorApp` to use the new configuration system.
    *   Implement configuration versioning and default/backward compatibility.
    *   Address memory management during refactoring.
3.  **Phase 2: API Enhancement**
    *   RESTful API for CRUD operations on configurations.
    *   API for initiating generation jobs with specific configurations.
    *   API for job status, results, and downloads.
    *   Reference data API endpoints.
    *   API security (authentication, rate limiting) and documentation.
4.  **Phase 3: Frontend Enhancement & SDK**
    *   New React-based `ConfigurationPanel` for advanced scenario configuration (fronts, nationalities, facilities, medical parameters).
    *   Integration of this panel into `static/index.html` via a modal.
    *   Python SDK for programmatic interaction with the new API.
5.  **Phase 4: Hardening, Technical Debt, and Final Touches**
    *   Address remaining technical debt (encryption salt, frontend architecture consolidation, bundle size optimization, Docker multi-stage builds).
    *   Expand testing coverage (API integration, E2E).
    *   Finalize all documentation.

### Overall Status

The project is at a pivotal point, transitioning from a functional application with some hardcoded limitations to a highly flexible, API-driven, and database-configurable system. The immediate next steps are foundational (database migration, Git setup) before tackling the core architectural changes.

### Known Issues

**Resolved Recently (Prior to New Initiative):**
*   Initial loading errors for the Enhanced Visualization Dashboard.
*   404 errors for visualization API endpoints.
*   500 Internal Server Error for `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data`.
*   React Testing Library `act()` warnings in frontend tests.
*   Implemented generation of multiple primary medical conditions.

**Current Considerations / Known Issues (To be addressed by new plan):**

1.  **Database System:** Currently SQLite, migrating to PostgreSQL. This addresses SQLite's limitations (connection pooling, migration management).
2.  **Configuration Hardcoding:** Core limitation being addressed by the new architecture.
3.  **Memory Management:** High memory usage with large datasets remains a concern; will be addressed during backend refactoring (Phase 1).
4.  **Error Handling:** Inconsistent error handling; will be standardized during new component development.
5.  **Frontend Architecture:** Mix of JS/React, bundle sizes; will be reviewed in Phase 4.
6.  **Security - Encryption Salt:** Fixed salt in `formatter.py`; scheduled for Phase 4.
7.  **Testing Coverage:** Needs expansion for new API and configuration logic.

### Next Steps

The project is currently executing **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup** as detailed in `memory-bank/active-context.md`. This involves:
*   Task 0.1: Update Memory Bank - Initial Plan (Completed)
*   Task 0.2: Establish Git Branching Model
*   Task 0.3: Setup PostgreSQL Database
*   Task 0.4: Integrate Alembic for Database Migrations
*   Task 0.5: Refactor `patient_generator/database.py` for PostgreSQL

Subsequent phases (1-4) will follow as outlined in `active-context.md`, focusing on backend abstraction, API development, frontend enhancements, and finally, hardening and documentation.
