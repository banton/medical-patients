# Future Enhancements

This document outlines potential areas for future enhancement, extension, and improvement in the Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator system. These are ideas for consideration beyond the currently planned work (see `open-tickets.md` and `active-context.md`).

## Functionality Enhancements

1.  **Advanced Medical Modeling**:
    *   Implement injury progression over time within a scenario (e.g., condition worsening if not treated).
    *   Model comorbidities and interactions between different medical conditions.
    *   Add more detailed medication regimens and treatment protocols, potentially with effectiveness rates.
    *   Introduce more granular control over specific SNOMED/LOINC codes used for less common conditions/observations.

2.  **Advanced Patient Flow & Resource Modeling**:
    *   Model medical facility capacity constraints (beds, staff, supplies).
    *   Implement priority-based evacuation logic based on triage category and available resources.
    *   Add more complex routing logic (e.g., specialized cases automatically routed to facilities with specific capabilities).
    *   Model delays due to tactical situations or resource limitations affecting evacuation and treatment.

3.  **Expanded Output Formats & Integrations**:
    *   PDF generation for printable patient records/summaries.
    *   Support for other healthcare data standards if required by users (e.g., HL7 v2 messages for older systems).
    *   Generate images/diagrams of injuries (e.g., body maps).
    *   Create barcode/QR code outputs for patient identification.

4.  **Language & Localization**:
    *   Translate the web UI into multiple languages (e.g., for NATO partners).
    *   Support generating patient demographic details (names, locations) in native character sets for more nationalities.

5.  **Scenario Realism & Dynamics**:
    *   Introduce time-phased events or triggers within a scenario (e.g., a sudden surge of casualties, a facility becoming temporarily unavailable).
    *   Allow for dynamic adjustment of parameters during a simulated exercise (if an API for "live" updates is considered).

## Technical Improvements

1.  **Performance Optimization (Beyond Current Scope)**:
    *   Explore advanced multi-threading/multi-processing for the Python generation core if current background tasks are insufficient for extreme scales.
    *   Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed reference data or intermediate generation steps if profiling shows benefits.
    *   Further optimize memory usage for extremely large patient counts (e.g., streaming FHIR bundle generation directly to disk/response).

2.  **API Enhancements**:
    *   Consider GraphQL endpoint for more flexible data querying, especially for complex configuration objects or result summaries.
    *   Implement WebSocket support for real-time progress updates to the UI, reducing polling.
    *   More granular API endpoints for managing sub-components of configurations if needed.

3.  **Security Enhancements (Beyond Basic API Key)**:
    *   Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect for user authentication and authorization for the UI and API.
    *   Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) for managing configurations and accessing sensitive data/operations.
    *   Add comprehensive audit logging for all configuration changes and generation jobs.

4.  **Advanced Testing Strategies**:
    *   Implement property-based testing for data generation logic to cover a wider range of inputs.
    *   Develop more sophisticated performance benchmarks and automated load testing.

## UI/UX Improvements

1.  **Advanced Configuration Interface**:
    *   Visual editor for casualty distributions (e.g., interactive charts/sliders).
    *   More sophisticated "impact preview" for configuration changes.
    *   Guided setup wizard for new users or complex scenario types.
    *   Drag-and-drop interface for reordering facilities in an evacuation chain.

2.  **Enhanced Visualization & Analytics**:
    *   Interactive patient flow diagrams (Sankey diagrams, etc.).
    *   Geographical distribution maps for casualties if location data becomes part of scenarios.
    *   Timeline views of patient progression and facility load.
    *   Comparative analytics between different generated datasets or scenario versions.

3.  **Patient Record Browser/Inspector**:
    *   A UI section to view details of individual (sample) generated patient records from a job.
    *   Filtering and searching capabilities within a generated dataset preview.

4.  **Mobile Support & Accessibility**:
    *   Optimize UI for responsiveness on tablets for field/exercise use.
    *   Ensure WCAG compliance for accessibility.

## Integration Opportunities

1.  **Medical Simulation Systems**:
    *   Develop connectors or standardized export formats for common medical simulation platforms.
    *   Support real-time data feeds for live exercises (would require significant architectural changes).

2.  **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems**:
    *   Explore direct import capabilities into training instances of EHRs.
    *   Implement a basic FHIR server capability to serve generated data.

3.  **External Data Sources**:
    *   Allow import of real-world casualty distribution data or medical knowledge to inform scenario configurations.
    *   Integrate with GIS data for geographical context if scenarios become map-based.

4.  **Exercise Management & AAR Systems**:
    *   Create plugins or export formats for common exercise management tools.
    *   Support data export suitable for After Action Review (AAR) systems.

## Deployment & Operational Improvements

1.  **Cloud-Native Deployment**:
    *   Develop Kubernetes deployment configurations (Helm charts).
    *   Explore serverless functions for specific API tasks or parts of the generation pipeline.
    *   Integrate with cloud storage solutions for output files.

2.  **Enhanced Installation & Update Mechanisms**:
    *   Create simplified installers or packages for non-Docker deployments if required.
    *   Implement a more robust self-update mechanism if deployed as a standalone application.

This list is intended to capture ideas for future consideration and is subject to change based on project priorities and user feedback.
