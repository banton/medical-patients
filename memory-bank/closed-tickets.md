__Ticket ID:__ TD-001 (Corresponds to Task 4.1.2) __Title:__ Frontend Architecture Consolidation: Unify Visualization Logic
__Epic:__ 4.1 Address Remaining Technical Debt
__Description:__ The current frontend has visualization logic present in both the older static JavaScript (`static/index.html` using Chart.js) and the newer React-based `ExerciseDashboard` component (`enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx` using Recharts). This task aims to consolidate visualization efforts, likely by migrating or ensuring all key visualizations are handled by the React components to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
__Acceptance Criteria Met:__
1. Analyze visualization capabilities of the legacy `static/index.html` (Chart.js) and the `ExerciseDashboard` React component. (Verified: No active Chart.js rendering in `static/index.html`.)
2. Identify any unique or critical visualizations in the legacy view that are not present or adequately represented in the React dashboard. (Verified: No unique graphical visualizations missing from React dashboard. `static/index.html` links to the React dashboard for comprehensive visualizations.)
3. If gaps exist, implement the missing/required visualizations within the `ExerciseDashboard` React component or a new dedicated React visualization component. (Verified: N/A, no gaps found.)
4. Ensure the React-based visualizations are configurable and can display data relevant to the new dynamic configuration system. (Verified: Existing React dashboard is configurable and uses data from the new system via API.)
5. Update `static/visualizations.html` to be the primary access point for comprehensive visualizations, potentially deprecating or simplifying visualizations in `static/index.html`. (Verified: `static/visualizations.html` is the primary access point. `static/index.html` appropriately links to it and serves job submission/basic status; no further deprecation of `index.html` content needed for this ticket's scope.)
6. Relevant Memory Bank documents (e.g., `system-patterns.md`, `tech-context.md`, `active-context.md`, `progress.md`) are updated to reflect the consolidated architecture. (Completed)
7. Code is reviewed and merged into the `develop` branch. (Completed: Documentation changes merged locally.)
__Status:__ Completed
__Branch:__ feature/TD-001-frontend-viz-consolidation
__Date Completed:__ 2025-05-20
__PR/Commit Reference:__ Commit `e9eba75` (local merge to develop)
__Test Results Summary:__ N/A (Task involved analysis and documentation updates, no new code functionality was added or changed that required specific tests for this ticket. Existing visualization functionality confirmed.)
__Lessons Learned:__ Initial ticket description implied potential code migration. Analysis revealed consolidation was already largely in place, shifting focus to verification and documentation. Importance of precise branch management highlighted during execution.
