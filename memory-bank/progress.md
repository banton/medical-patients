# Progress

## Current Status

The Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator has undergone a major architectural overhaul, completing Phases 0-3 of the enhanced configurability initiative. This includes:
*   Migration to a PostgreSQL database with Alembic for schema management.
*   A new backend architecture for dynamic configuration of scenarios (fronts, facilities, nationalities, injury distributions).
*   A comprehensive RESTful API for managing configurations and patient generation jobs.
*   An initial frontend UI (React-based modal) for advanced scenario configuration.
*   A Python SDK for programmatic API interaction.

The project is currently at the **beginning of Phase 4: Hardening, Technical Debt, and Final Touches**.

### What Works (After Phases 0-3 of New Initiative)

1.  **Core Patient Generation (Now Configurable)**:
    *   Patient flow simulation through dynamically configured medical facility chains.
    *   Demographics generation supporting all NATO nations (via `demographics.json`).
    *   Configurable front definitions, casualty rates, and per-front nationality distributions.
    *   Configurable overall injury type distribution and total patient counts.
    *   Medical condition generation (SNOMED CT, multiple primary conditions) - *largely unchanged but now driven by configurable inputs*.
    *   HL7 FHIR R4 bundle creation.

2.  **Database & Configuration**:
    *   PostgreSQL backend database.
    *   Alembic for database schema migrations (initial tables for jobs and configurations created).
    *   Configuration templates can be saved, loaded, updated, and deleted via API.
    *   Configuration versioning (basic fields added).

3.  **API Layer**:
    *   RESTful API (`/api/v1/configurations/`) for CRUD operations on configuration templates.
    *   API endpoint (`/api/v1/configurations/validate/`) for validating configurations.
    *   Reference data API endpoints for nationalities and condition types.
    *   Main generation API (`/api/generate`) now accepts `configuration_id` or ad-hoc configuration.
    *   Job status, results summary, and download APIs are functional.
    *   Basic API key authentication and rate limiting applied to configuration API.

4.  **Web Interface**:
    *   Existing main UI (`static/index.html`) for basic generation (now needs to be adapted to use new config system or a default config ID).
    *   **New Advanced Configuration Panel**: A React-based modal (`ConfigurationPanel.tsx`) integrated into `static/index.html` for creating, loading, and editing detailed scenario configurations (fronts, facilities, etc.).
    *   Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (`static/visualizations.html`) remains functional.

5.  **Python SDK**:
    *   A client library (`patient_generator_sdk.py`) for interacting with the new API.

3.  **Output Options**:
    *   JSON and XML formatting
    *   Compression with gzip
    *   Encryption with AES-256-GCM
    *   NDEF formatting for NFC tags

4.  **Command Line Support**:
    *   Demo script for direct usage
    *   Configuration via JSON - *to be updated for new configuration structure*.

5.  **Testing**:
    *   Unit tests for core Python components.
    *   Frontend tests for `enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx` using Jest and React Testing Library.
    *   All existing unit tests (Python and frontend) were passing prior to this new initiative.

6.  **Docker Development Environment**:
    *   Docker Compose files (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`) updated for PostgreSQL.

### What's Left to Build/Improve (Focus of Phase 4)

1.  **Technical Debt Resolution**:
    *   **Security - Encryption Salt**: Refactor `formatter.py` to use unique, random salts for encryption (Task 4.1.1). (Completed)
    *   **Frontend Architecture Consolidation**: Review and potentially unify visualization logic between `index.html` and `visualizations.html` (Task 4.1.2).
    *   **Frontend Bundle Size Optimization**: Optimize bundles for `enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx` and `ConfigurationPanel.tsx` (Task 4.1.3).
    *   **Docker Optimization**: Implement multi-stage builds and review container security (Task 4.1.4).
2.  **Testing Expansion**:
    *   Develop comprehensive API integration tests (Task 4.2.1).
    *   Consider and implement End-to-End (E2E) tests for key user flows (Task 4.2.2).
3.  **Documentation Finalization**:
    *   Update user guides for the new configuration panel and API usage (Task 4.3.1).
    *   Ensure all technical documentation (Memory Bank, READMEs, SDK docs) is current and complete (Task 4.3.2).
4.  **UI/UX Refinements for Configuration Panel**:
    *   More detailed editing UIs for front/facility nationality distributions, etc.
    *   Drag-and-drop for reordering facilities.
    *   Enhanced parameter impact preview.
    *   Robust error handling and user feedback.
5.  **Default Configuration Seeding**:
    *   Create and execute a script to seed the database with the "Default Scenario (Legacy)" configuration template.
6.  **Main UI (`static/index.html`) Adaptation**:
    *   Update the main generation form to either use a default `configuration_id` or allow selection from saved templates, rather than individual parameter inputs.
7.  **UI for Static Fronts Configuration (New - Phase 4, Epic 4.4)**:
    *   Task 4.4.1: Create a UI section in the advanced configuration panel to view (and eventually edit) parameters from `patient_generator/fronts_config.json`. (Pending)

### Overall Status

Phases 0-3 of the enhanced configurability initiative are complete. The system now has a flexible backend, a comprehensive API, and an initial UI for advanced configuration. The current focus is on Phase 4: hardening the system, addressing technical debt, improving test coverage, and finalizing documentation to ensure a robust and maintainable application.

### Known Issues

**Resolved Recently (Prior to New Initiative):**
*   Initial loading errors for the Enhanced Visualization Dashboard.
*   404 errors for visualization API endpoints.
*   500 Internal Server Error for `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data`.
*   React Testing Library `act()` warnings in frontend tests.
*   Implemented generation of multiple primary medical conditions.

**Current Considerations / Known Issues (Focus of Phase 4):**

1.  **Security - Encryption Salt:** Fixed salt in `formatter.py` has been addressed by implementing PBKDF2 with unique salts per encryption. (Completed)
2.  **Frontend Architecture & Performance:** Bundle sizes and potential duplication in visualization logic.
3.  **Testing Coverage:** API and E2E tests are needed.
4.  **API Key Management:** The current hardcoded API key is a placeholder and needs a secure solution.
5.  **Pylance Type Errors & Warnings (May 2025):**
    *   Most Pylance errors in `patient_generator/database.py` and `patient_generator/formatter.py` have been addressed through type hinting and code logic refinements.
    *   Persistent Pylance errors in `app.py` (related to `None` type assignment in specific key functions) remain despite several attempts to clarify type flow; these are likely linter-specific or caching issues as the runtime logic appears sound.
    *   "Possibly unbound" warnings for cryptography components in `patient_generator/formatter.py` persist; these are likely due to Pylance's handling of conditional imports, while the runtime code correctly guards against missing `cryptography`.
    *   Import warnings for `slowapi` in `app.py` and `requests` in `patient_generator_sdk.py` should be resolved by ensuring the Python environment is up-to-date with `requirements.txt` (which now includes `requests` and already had `slowapi`).

### Next Steps

The project is currently at the **beginning of Phase 4: Hardening, Technical Debt, and Final Touches**, as detailed in `memory-bank/active-context.md`. The immediate tasks will focus on the items listed under "What's Left to Build/Improve (Focus of Phase 4)".
