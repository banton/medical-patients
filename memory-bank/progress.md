# Progress

## Current Status

The Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator has undergone a major architectural overhaul, completing Phases 0-3 of the enhanced configurability initiative. This includes:
*   Migration to a PostgreSQL database with Alembic for schema management.
*   A new backend architecture for dynamic configuration of scenarios (fronts, facilities, nationalities, injury distributions).
*   A comprehensive RESTful API for managing configurations and patient generation jobs.
*   An initial frontend UI (React-based modal) for advanced scenario configuration.
*   A Python SDK for programmatic API interaction.

The project is currently in **Phase 4: Hardening, Technical Debt, and Final Touches**.

### What Works (After Phases 0-3 of New Initiative)

1.  **Core Patient Generation (Now Configurable)**:
    *   Patient flow simulation through dynamically configured medical facility chains.
    *   Demographics generation supporting all NATO nations (via `demographics.json`, driven by `NationalityDataProvider`).
    *   Configurable front definitions, casualty rates, and per-front nationality distributions (managed via API and DB).
    *   Configurable overall injury type distribution and total patient counts.
    *   Medical condition generation (SNOMED CT, multiple primary conditions) driven by configurable inputs.
    *   HL7 FHIR R4 bundle creation.

2.  **Database & Configuration**:
    *   PostgreSQL backend database.
    *   Alembic for database schema migrations (initial tables for jobs and configurations created and versioned).
    *   Configuration templates can be created, read, updated, deleted, and validated via the API (`/api/v1/configurations/`).
    *   Configuration versioning (basic fields `version` and `parent_config_id` in DB and Pydantic models).

3.  **API Layer (`/api/v1/`)**:
    *   RESTful API for CRUD operations on configuration templates.
    *   API endpoint for validating configurations.
    *   Reference data API endpoints for nationalities and condition types.
    *   Main generation API (`/api/generate/`) accepts `configuration_id` or ad-hoc configuration.
    *   Job status, results summary, and download APIs are functional.
    *   Basic API key authentication and rate limiting applied to configuration API.
    *   Auto-generated OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.

4.  **Web Interface**:
    *   Existing main UI (`static/index.html`) for basic generation (needs adaptation to use new config system).
    *   **New Advanced Configuration Panel**: A React-based modal (`ConfigurationPanel.tsx`) integrated into `static/index.html` for creating, loading, and editing detailed scenario configurations.
        *   Supports management of fronts (including ordered nationality distribution per front) and facilities.
        *   Handles overall injury distribution (fixed categories: Battle Injury, Disease, Non-Battle Injury).
        *   Basic API error display.
    *   Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (`static/visualizations.html`) remains functional.

5.  **Python SDK (`patient_generator_sdk.py`)**:
    *   A client library for interacting with the new configuration and generation APIs.
    *   Includes basic examples.

6.  **Output Options**:
    *   JSON and XML formatting.
    *   Compression with gzip.
    *   Encryption with AES-256-GCM (now using unique salts per encryption via PBKDF2 - Task 4.1.1 Completed).

7.  **Command Line Support**:
    *   Demo script (`demo.py`) - *needs update to use SDK or new configuration methods*.
    *   Configuration via JSON - *needs update for new configuration structure*.

8.  **Testing**:
    *   Unit tests for core Python components (ongoing relevance to be checked against refactored code).
    *   Frontend tests for `enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx` using Jest and React Testing Library.

9.  **Docker Development Environment**:
    *   Docker Compose files (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, etc.) updated for PostgreSQL.
    *   `start-dev.sh` script automates:
        *   Frontend dependency installation (`npm install`).
        *   Frontend asset building (`npm run build:all-frontend`).
        *   Docker service startup (FastAPI app, PostgreSQL DB).
        *   DB health checks before applying Alembic migrations.
        *   Alembic migrations (`alembic upgrade head`).

### What's Left to Build/Improve (Focus of Phase 4)

1.  **Technical Debt Resolution**:
    *   Frontend Architecture Consolidation (Task 4.1.2): Review and potentially unify visualization logic.
    *   Frontend Bundle Size Optimization (Task 4.1.3): Optimize bundles for all React components.
    *   Docker Optimization (Task 4.1.4): Implement multi-stage builds, review container security.
2.  **Testing Expansion**:
    *   API Integration Tests (Task 4.2.1): Develop comprehensive tests for the new API.
    *   End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Task 4.2.2): Implement E2E tests for key user flows.
    *   Review and update existing Python unit tests for compatibility with refactored code.
3.  **Documentation Finalization (Current Task - 4.3.2)**:
    *   Update User Guides for new configuration panel and API (Task 4.3.1).
    *   Update all Technical Documentation (Memory Bank, READMEs, SDK docs).
4.  **UI/UX Refinements & Enhancements**:
    *   UI for Static Fronts Configuration (Task 4.4.1): View/edit `patient_generator/fronts_config.json` parameters via `ConfigurationPanel.tsx`.
    *   More robust error handling and user feedback in `ConfigurationPanel.tsx`.
    *   Potential enhancements like drag-and-drop for reordering facilities.
5.  **Default Configuration Seeding**:
    *   Create and execute a script to seed the database with a "Default Scenario (Legacy)" configuration template.
6.  **Main UI (`static/index.html`) Adaptation**:
    *   Update the main generation form to use a default `configuration_id` or allow selection from saved templates.
7.  **Command Line Support Update**:
    *   Update `demo.py` and guidance for CLI usage to align with the new SDK/API and configuration system.
8.  **API Key Management**:
    *   Replace placeholder API key with a more secure management solution.

### Overall Status

Phases 0-3 of the enhanced configurability initiative are complete. The system now boasts a flexible PostgreSQL-backed backend, a comprehensive API, an initial UI for advanced configuration, and a Python SDK. The development environment is streamlined with Docker and the `start-dev.sh` script.

The current focus is **Phase 4: Hardening, Technical Debt, and Final Touches**. This involves refining the system, addressing remaining technical debt, significantly improving test coverage, completing all documentation, and adding final UI enhancements.

### Known Issues

**Recently Resolved:**
*   **Security - Encryption Salt (Task 4.1.1):** Fixed salt in `formatter.py` addressed by implementing PBKDF2 with unique salts. (Completed)
*   **Alembic Multiple Heads:** Resolved by user, allowing migrations to proceed. (Completed by User)
*   **Missing DB Columns for Versioning:** `version` and `parent_config_id` columns added to `configuration_templates` via migration `2b84a220e9ac`. (Completed)
*   **UI - Nationality Distribution (Task 4.1.5):** Updated to ordered list of dropdowns. (Completed)
*   **UI - Injury Distribution (Task 4.1.6):** Reverted to simpler fixed categories. (Completed)
*   **DB - `parent_config_id` usage (Task 4.1.7):** Corrected in database queries. (Completed)
*   Issues from before the new initiative (Enhanced Viz Dashboard loading, API errors, `act()` warnings) are considered superseded or resolved by the new architecture and subsequent fixes.

**Current Considerations / Known Issues (Focus of Phase 4):**

1.  **Frontend Architecture & Performance:** Bundle sizes for React components and potential duplication in visualization logic (Tasks 4.1.2, 4.1.3).
2.  **Testing Coverage:** API integration tests and E2E tests are needed (Task 4.2.1, 4.2.2). Existing Python unit tests need review.
3.  **API Key Management:** Current hardcoded API key is a placeholder and needs a secure solution.
4.  **Pylance Type Errors & Warnings (Ongoing):**
    *   Most Pylance errors in `patient_generator/database.py` and `patient_generator/formatter.py` have been addressed.
    *   Persistent Pylance errors in `app.py` remain.
    *   "Possibly unbound" warnings for cryptography components in `patient_generator/formatter.py` persist.
    *   Import warnings for `slowapi` and `requests` should be resolved by environment updates.
5.  **Memory Management (Backend):** While initial improvements were made in Phase 1, ongoing monitoring and potential optimization for very large, complex configurations may be needed.
6.  **Error Handling Standardization:** Continue to ensure consistent and user-friendly error handling across all new components and APIs.

### Next Steps

The project is currently executing **Phase 4: Hardening, Technical Debt, and Final Touches**, as detailed in `memory-bank/active-context.md`.
The immediate task is **Task 4.3.2: Update all Technical Documentation (Memory Bank, READMEs, SDK)**, which is currently in progress.
Following this, other Phase 4 tasks such as testing expansion, remaining UI enhancements, and technical debt items will be addressed.
