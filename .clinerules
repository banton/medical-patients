# Cline's Project Intelligence (.clinerules)

## Project: Medical Patients Data System

*This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help Cline work more effectively on this specific project. It's a living document that grows as the project evolves.*

### Initial Observations & Rules:

1.  **Memory Bank First:** Always read and update the Memory Bank files (`memory-bank/*.md`) at the start of a session and after significant changes. This is crucial for maintaining context.
2.  **File Structure Awareness:** The project has a Python backend (`app.py`, `patient_generator/`) and a static HTML frontend (`static/index.html`). Be mindful of this separation when making changes.
3.  **Python Focus:** The core logic resides in Python modules. Pay attention to Python best practices, dependencies (`requirements.txt`), and packaging (`setup.py`).
4.  **Iterative Documentation:** The Memory Bank files are now comprehensive and detailed, reflecting a mature project state. They should continue to be updated iteratively as the project evolves or new insights are gained.
5.  **User Interaction:** The presence of `static/index.html` implies user interaction. Consider how backend changes might affect the frontend experience.
6.  **Patient Data Core:** The `patient_generator` module is central. Understand its sub-modules (`demographics.py`, `fhir_generator.py`, etc.) and their roles.

### Tool Usage Patterns:

*   (To be populated as patterns emerge)

### User Preferences & Workflow:

*   (To be populated based on interactions)

### Known Challenges & Considerations:

*   Maintaining consistency across all Memory Bank files.
*   Ensuring `.clinerules` accurately reflects the evolving project intelligence.
