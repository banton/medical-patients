## Getting Started

The application uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for cross-platform development workflows, providing a consistent experience across macOS and Linux.

### Prerequisites

**Supported Operating Systems**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 11+, RHEL 8+) and macOS (11.0+)

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Version control
-   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - Container runtime (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose)
-   [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) - Cross-platform task runner
-   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - For local development (optional)
-   [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) - For timeline viewer (optional)

### Quick Start

The easiest way to get started:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/banton/medical-patients.git
cd medical-patients

# 2. Install Task (if needed)
# macOS: brew install go-task
# Linux: curl -sL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# 3. Run setup (creates .env, starts database)
task init

# 4. Start development server
task dev

# 5. Open http://localhost:8000
```

That's it! The application is now running.

### Alternative: Docker-Only Setup

If you prefer everything in Docker:

```bash
task init       # Setup environment
task start      # Run everything in Docker
task logs       # View logs
```

### Advanced Setup Options

For Ubuntu 24.04 or if you need Python virtual environments:
```bash
task init:full  # Full setup with OS detection and Python environment
```

**Note**: Ubuntu 24.04 users may need to activate the virtual environment first:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
task dev
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Essential Commands
task            # Show available commands
task init       # First-time setup
task dev        # Start development server
task stop       # Stop all services
task test       # Run tests

# Additional Commands  
task status     # Check service health
task logs       # View application logs
task timeline   # Open timeline viewer (optional)
task clean      # Reset everything

# Advanced Commands
task db-reset   # Reset database (destroys data!)
task init:full  # Full setup with Python environment
task help:staging # Learn about staging deployment
```

💡 **Tip**: Most developers only need `task init` and `task dev`. Everything else is optional.

### Manual Setup (Advanced)

For development without Task:

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL and Redis
docker compose up -d db redis

# 2. Install Python dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 4. Start the application
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Ubuntu 24.04 enforces PEP 668 which requires virtual environments. The `task init:full` command handles this automatically. If you need manual setup:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev build-essential
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Common Issues

- **"externally-managed-environment" error**: Use `task init:full` or create a virtual environment manually
- **psycopg2 installation fails**: Install `libpq-dev` with `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`
- **Permission denied errors**: Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` (then logout/login)
- **Port already in use**: Check with `sudo lsof -i :8000` and stop conflicting services

## Production Deployment

The application is designed for deployment on traditional VPS infrastructure or containerized environments.

3. **Kubernetes**: Deploy containers using the Docker images

### Staging Environment (Optional)

Staging deployment is **only needed** if you're planning to:
- Test production deployment configurations
- Validate server-specific settings
- Run load testing before production

To use staging:
1. Create `.env.staging` with production-like settings
2. Run `task staging:up` to start on port 8001
3. Test your deployment configuration
4. Use `task staging:down` when finished

**Note**: Most users don't need staging. The `task dev` command provides a complete development environment.
