# Progress

## Current Status

The Military Medical Exercise Patient Generator appears to be a well-structured and developed project with comprehensive functionality. Based on the codebase, here's an assessment of its current status.

### What Works

1. **Core Patient Generation**:
   - Patient flow simulation through medical facilities (POI, R1-R4)
   - Realistic demographics generation based on nationality
   - Medical condition generation using SNOMED CT codes, now with support for multiple primary conditions of the same injury type, enhancing medical realism.
   - HL7 FHIR R4 bundle creation, updated to correctly represent multiple primary conditions.

2. **Web Interface**:
   - Configuration form for generation parameters (`static/index.html`).
   - Job management system (`static/index.html`).
   - Progress tracking (`static/index.html`).
   - Data visualization of generation results (basic visualizations in `static/index.html`).
   - **Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (`static/visualizations.html`)**:
     - Successfully loads and displays advanced visualizations using React, Recharts, and Lucide-React.
     - Fetches data from backend API endpoints (`/api/visualizations/job-list`, `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data`).
     - The TSX component (`enhanced-visualization-dashboard.tsx`) is compiled using `esbuild` into `static/dist/bundle.js`.
   - File download functionality.

3. **Output Options**:
   - JSON and XML formatting
   - Compression with gzip
   - Encryption with AES-256-GCM
   - NDEF formatting for NFC tags

4. **Command Line Support**:
   - Demo script for direct usage
   - Configuration via JSON

5. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for core components.
   - Test fixtures for different scenarios.
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the `patient_generator.visualization_data.transform_job_data_for_visualization` function, covering various data scenarios (empty lists, different patient flows, distributions).
   - As part of this testing, a bug was identified and fixed in `transform_job_data_for_visualization` where default Sankey diagram nodes were not correctly initialized when no patient data was present. All Python unit tests are currently passing.
   - **Frontend Testing (Enhanced Visualization Dashboard)**:
     - Jest and React Testing Library configured for `enhanced-visualization-dashboard.test.tsx`.
     - All frontend tests are passing, including those for data loading, tab navigation, and filtering.
     - Initial `act()` warnings during test runs have been resolved.

6. **Docker Development Environment**:
   - `Dockerfile` fixed and `docker-compose.dev.yml` successfully builds and runs.
   - Web interface and API docs accessible in the dev container.

### What's Left to Build/Improve

Reflecting the technical review, key areas for improvement include:

1.  **Memory Management**:
    *   Implement streaming/generator patterns for patient data processing (backend).
    *   Serialize large datasets to disk instead of keeping them in memory.
    *   Add pagination for large result sets (API and UI).
2.  **Error Handling Standardization**:
    *   Define custom exception hierarchy and implement consistent error handling (backend).
    *   Implement React Error Boundaries and improve error feedback/retry mechanisms (frontend).
3.  **Frontend Architecture**:
    *   Optimize `static/dist/bundle.js` size (externalize libraries, code splitting).
    *   Consolidate visualization logic between `static/index.html` and the enhanced dashboard.
    *   Implement consistent state management for the React dashboard.
4.  **Configuration Management**:
    *   Centralize configuration with a dedicated module and Pydantic validation.
5.  **Testing Coverage**:
    *   Expand API integration tests.
    *   Increase unit test coverage for frontend and backend components.
    *   Consider end-to-end testing.
6.  **Database Implementation**:
    *   Address connection pooling for SQLite.
    *   Ensure consistent use of parameterized queries.
    *   Consider a migration management system.
7.  **Docker Optimization**:
    *   Implement multi-stage builds for smaller images.
    *   Optimize Docker Compose configurations.
    *   Enhance container security.
8.  **Security**:
    *   Address fixed salt in encryption.
    *   Comprehensive input validation.
9.  **Documentation**:
    *   Expand API documentation, user guides, and technical documentation (including frontend build/test processes and Docker).
10. **Extended Features (General)**:
    *   Additional nationalities, medical conditions, etc.
    *   Integration with other systems.
11. **UI Enhancements (Beyond current dashboard)**:
    *   Patient record viewer, advanced filtering, user authentication.

### Overall Status

The project is in a strong functional state with robust core patient generation capabilities and significantly improved data visualization through the new React-based enhanced dashboard. Both web interfaces (main generator and advanced visualizations) and command-line support are operational. The introduction of frontend testing and a build process marks a significant step in modernizing the frontend architecture. The codebase remains well-structured.

The application is near production-ready, with comprehensive features and a solid testing foundation for both backend and key frontend components.

### Known Issues

**Resolved Recently:**
-   Initial loading errors for the Enhanced Visualization Dashboard (related to Babel, Recharts, and TSX compilation) have been fixed.
-   404 errors for visualization API endpoints (e.g., `/api/visualizations/job-list`) have been resolved (primarily by ensuring backend server runs latest code).
-   500 Internal Server Error for `/api/visualizations/dashboard-data` (caused by `TypeError` in data transformation) has been fixed.
-   React Testing Library `act()` warnings in frontend tests have been resolved.
-   Implemented generation of multiple primary medical conditions, improving data realism.

**Current Considerations / Known Issues (incorporating technical review):**

1.  **Memory Management**: High memory usage with large datasets is a primary concern (backend `jobs[job_id]["patients_data"]`, FHIR generation).
2.  **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across backend and frontend.
3.  **Frontend Architecture**:
    *   Mix of traditional JS and React/TSX with duplicate visualization logic.
    *   Large bundle size for `static/dist/bundle.js` (~2.1MB).
    *   Inconsistent state management in the React dashboard.
    *   Minor `recharts` console warning in JSDOM tests (width/height 0) - low priority.
4.  **Configuration Management**: Potential for redundant configuration.
5.  **Testing Coverage**: Uneven, particularly for API integration and some frontend areas.
6.  **Database Implementation**: Limited SQLite connection pooling, potential SQL injection risks, no migration management.
7.  **Docker Optimization**: Large container images, unoptimized Docker Compose files.
8.  **Security**:
    *   Fixed salt in encryption implementation.
    *   Limited input validation in some areas.
9.  **Scalability**: Backend patient generation has sequential parts.
10. **Internationalization**: UI is English only.

### Next Steps

The refactoring roadmap outlined in `memory-bank/active-context.md` (based on the technical review) provides the detailed next steps, prioritized into phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Critical Improvements** (Memory Management, Error Handling, Configuration)
2.  **Phase 2: Frontend Improvements** (Architecture, UX)
3.  **Phase 3: Testing and Documentation**
4.  **Phase 4: Deployment Optimizations** (Docker, Database)

Refer to `active-context.md` for the specific tasks within these phases.
