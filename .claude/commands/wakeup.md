Following @claude.md guidance, access @memory/current-session.md and confirm the current focus in this session. If you are not focused on the current task or need assistance, please let me know. Once you have done this, SUGGEST the next steps for this session and ask for confirmation from the user.

Always remember the rules of engagement:
1. Always update your memory when you learn you information as Claude.md dictates
2. Always follow proper git workflow
3. Never push to main branch, as it is live and hot
4. Always run full tests before pushing changes
5. Suggest new tasks after you have completed the current task or need assistance
