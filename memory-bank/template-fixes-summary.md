# Template Configuration Fixes

## Issue Identified
The configuration templates had the following problems:
1. **Front casualty rates didn't add up to 100%** - They were using decimal values (0.3, 0.2) instead of percentages
2. **Incorrect casualty rate distribution** - Multiple fronts with rates that didn't sum to 100%
3. **Missing validation** - No clear indication that front casualty rates must total 100%

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Template Casualty Rates
Fixed all default templates in `static/js/modules/persistence.js`:

- **NATO Exercise Template**:
  - Eastern Front: 60% (was 0.3)
  - Northern Front: 40% (was 0.2)
  - Total: 100% ✓

- **Single Nation Training**:
  - Training Area: 100% (was 0.15)
  - Total: 100% ✓

- **Humanitarian Mission**:
  - Relief Zone: 100% (was 0.25)
  - Total: 100% ✓

### 2. Added New Multi-Theater Template
Created a "Large Scale Operation" template demonstrating proper multi-front distribution:
- Eastern Theater: 45%
- Southern Theater: 30%
- Northern Theater: 25%
- Total: 100% ✓

### 3. Verified Nationality Distributions
All nationality distributions within each front correctly sum to 100%:
- Each front's nationality percentages are properly balanced
- All templates now have complete and valid data

## Validation Rules
The system expects:
1. **Front Casualty Rates**: Must sum to 100% across all fronts
2. **Nationality Distributions**: Must sum to 100% within each front
3. **Injury Distributions**: Must sum to 100% (Disease + Non-Battle + Battle)
4. **Facility Rates**: KIA rate + RTD rate must not exceed 1.0 (100%)

## Testing
- Rebuilt frontend components with `npm run build:all-frontend`
- Templates are now ready for use with proper percentage distributions
