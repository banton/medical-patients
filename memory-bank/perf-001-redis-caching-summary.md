# PERF-001: Redis Caching Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Redis caching layer to improve performance for patient generation operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- Added Redis service to docker-compose.yml with health checks
- Configured Redis environment variables (REDIS_URL, CACHE_TTL, CACHE_ENABLED)
- Updated requirements.txt with redis and hiredis dependencies

### 2. Core Cache Service (src/core/cache.py)
- Created CacheService class with async Redis operations
- Implemented methods: get, set, delete, invalidate_pattern, exists, health_check
- Added connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Integrated cache initialization into FastAPI lifespan management

### 3. Cached Services
- **CachedDemographicsService**: Caches demographics.json data for 24 hours
- **CachedMedicalService**: Caches medical conditions pool data for 24 hours
- Both services provide cache warming and invalidation capabilities

### 4. Integration
- Updated AsyncPatientGenerationService to use cached services
- Cache warming occurs before patient generation starts
- Health endpoint now includes Redis status check

### 5. Testing
- Comprehensive test suite for CacheService functionality
- Tests for cached demographics and medical services
- Mock-based tests for Redis error scenarios

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Selective Caching**: Only static data (demographics, medical conditions pools) is cached. Individual patient data and random selections are not cached to maintain variability.

2. **TTL Strategy**: 
   - Demographics/Medical data: 24 hours (rarely changes)
   - Default TTL: 1 hour (configurable via CACHE_TTL env var)

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Application continues without caching if Redis is unavailable

4. **Cache Key Structure**:
   - demographics:json - Full demographics data
   - medical:data - Medical conditions pools
   - Pattern-based invalidation supported

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced File I/O**: Demographics.json and medical conditions no longer loaded from disk on every request
2. **Faster Patient Generation**: Pre-warmed caches eliminate initialization overhead
3. **Scalability**: Redis connection pooling supports concurrent requests efficiently

## Configuration

```bash
# Environment variables
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CACHE_TTL=3600  # 1 hour default
CACHE_ENABLED=True
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor cache hit rates in production
2. Consider caching configuration templates
3. Add Redis cluster support for high availability
4. Implement cache metrics/monitoring
